			<Text>Arrabales were neighborhoods built on Argentina, usually linked to the working class of the country. It is within Arrabales where Tango was born. The tango’s roots make it a song for marginalized people. The tango’s vibrant beat fuses traditions of European immigrants, South-American natives and descendants of African slaves. The tango is the product of a concrete historical process: a biological and cultural mix that took place in the urban suburbs of Buenos Aires from the end of the nineteenth century until the 1960s. The soul of Buenos Aires is expressed through this song. The tango reflects its inhabitants’ way of being and its folklore.</Text>
