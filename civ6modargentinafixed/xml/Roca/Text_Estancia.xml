			<Text>Estancias, or ranches, play a huge part in Argentina's culture, economy and history. In the early days these establishments were responsible for making Argentina one of the biggest meat and grain producers in the world. These enormous ranches dotted the entire countryside and are to this day where the best steaks in the world come from. During the conflicts with the Mapuche and Pehuelche Estancias also served as important defense points for the frontier.</Text>
