# civ6_mod_argentina
Fixes to the original Leugi's Argentina Civilization for Rise and Fall

Adds Jose de San Martin, Julio Roca, Eva Peron and the Argentina Civilization for Civilization VI.

This repository is based on the original mod and it only has minor changes to support Rise and Fall expansion.

All credits goes to the original creators.

Known issues: Riding across mountains with San Martin seems to mess and allow the entire set of units for all civs to walk across mountains. So I've disabled that unique ability until I've time to look for a fix.

Instructions:
1. Install the original mod from https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=910530559&searchtext=argentina
2. Go to the mod installation folder, and overwrite the files with the files on this repository.
3. Open Civ VI
